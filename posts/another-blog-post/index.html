It had become a wait-and-see situation with the final results no longer in her control. That didn&rsquo;t stop her from trying to control the situation. She demanded that things be done as she desperately tried to control what couldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. The morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air. There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I&rsquo;d love to get together and tell you about it if you&rsquo;re up for a cup of coffee,&rdquo; he continued, laying the trap he&rsquo;d been planning for years.</p><p>With six children in tow, Catherine raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn&rsquo;t an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane.</p><p>There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.</p><p>One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack&rsquo;s only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He&rsquo;s lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.</p><p>The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound of the shower&rsquo;s running water. It was the same way each day began since he could remember. It listened intently and concluded that the singing today was as terrible as it had ever been.</p><p>Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. What can explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders. The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://pagi-maula.github.io/posts/in-plane-sight/><span class=button__text>In plane sight</span>
