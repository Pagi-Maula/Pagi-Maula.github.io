There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away.</p><p>Although Scott said it didn&rsquo;t matter to him, he knew deep inside that it did. They had been friends as long as he could remember and not once had he had to protest that something Joe apologized for doing didn&rsquo;t really matter. Scott stuck to his lie and insisted again and again that everything was fine as Joe continued to apologize. Scott already knew that despite his words accepting the apologies that their friendship would never be the same.</p><p>You&rsquo;re going to make a choice today that will have a direct impact on where you are five years from now. The truth is, you&rsquo;ll make choice like that every day of your life. The problem is that on most days, you won&rsquo;t know the choice you make will have such a huge impact on your life in the future. So if you want to end up in a certain place in the future, you need to be careful of the choices you make today.</p><p>One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack&rsquo;s only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He&rsquo;s lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.</p><p>There had to be a better way. That&rsquo;s all Nancy could think as she sat at her desk staring at her computer screen. She&rsquo;d already spent five years of her life in this little cubicle staring at her computer doing &ldquo;work&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t seem to matter to anyone including her own boss. There had to be more to her life than this and there had to be a better way to make a living. That&rsquo;s what she was thinking when the earthquake struck.</p><p>The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one in the area, but the light shining in his eyes proved him wrong. It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so directly into his eyes he couldn&rsquo;t make out anything about the person holding the light. There was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flashlight of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding him. He turned it on and pointed it into the stranger&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn&rsquo;t scientifically prove any of this, but that didn&rsquo;t matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to.</p><p>April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices. She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon sleeping with her every night?</p><p>Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one doesn’t get enough sleep one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. Studies have shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one’s ability to do simple math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as driving drunk. Moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be induced by lack of sleep. As much as people try to do without enough sleep it is a wonder more crazy things don’t happen in this world.</p><p>She needed glasses. It wasn&rsquo;t that she couldn&rsquo;t see without them, but what she could see with them. When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://pagi-maula.github.io/posts/another-blog-post/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
