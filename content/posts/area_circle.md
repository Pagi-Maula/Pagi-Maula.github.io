Ever wondered how much cloth I need to cover a circular table ? Did some math there ?

Well, that put simply area of the circle is equal to amount of cloth needed to cover it.

In mathematical terms, area of a circle is the region enclosed within the boundary .i.e circumference.

> The formula for Area of a circle is **A = πr²** , where **π = constant ( 3.142 or 22/7)** **r = radius of the circle**

> Since radius = diameter / 2 , we can rewrite area of circle as , **A = πd, where π = constant ( 3.142 or 22/7) r = diameter of the circle**

Just remember these two formulas, and any problem on area of circle can be solved quickly.

Few examples of area of circle questions, **Example 1:** If the length of the radius of a circle is 7 units. Calculate its area.

**Solution:** Radius(r) = 7 units(given) Using the formula for the circle’s area, Area of a Circle = πr² Put the values, A = π (7)² A =π × 49 A = 22/7 × 49 …… ( π = 22/7, using this for ease of calculation) A = 154 sq.units.

**Example 2:** If the area of a circle is 44 sq. units find its diameter.

**Solution:** Area(A) = 44 sq.units(given) Using the formula for the circle’s area, Area of a Circle = πd Put the values, 44 = π × d 44 = 22/7 × d 2 × 7 = d ….. ( cancelling out 22 × 2 = 44) d = 14 units.

Easy right ? Who said Math was hard !

Just remember the formulae.

Thank you for reading.
